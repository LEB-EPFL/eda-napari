## Features

### Frame rate plugin

This widget reads metadata from tif files originating from microscope imaging. From a time-lapse image stack, the widget reads the capture time of each individual image. This time data is stored and the frame rate is approximated from this data.
This plugin make three plots visibles:
One of the actual elapsed time in the video against the actual frame number.
One of the frame rate as a funtion of the time elapsed.
One of the frame rate as a function of the frame number.
In all plots the actual frame number and time are pointed out by a red vertical line.


### Time scroll plugin

This widget is to animate the time-lapse linearly in time. This is useful because napariâ€™s scroll bar animates individual frames with a constant time interval without taking into account the actual time from the metadata. In the time scroller it is also possible to modify the speed of the animation thanks to a speed up and a speed down button.
